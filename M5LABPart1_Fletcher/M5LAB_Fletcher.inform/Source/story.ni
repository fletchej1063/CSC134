Entrance is a room."You are at the entrance. Looks pretty spooky. Two exits north and south."
The Outside Clearing is south of the Entrance. "You decided to retreat and live another day."
The Death Room is north of the Entrance. "Are you sure you want to stay in here? Just look at the description! Quick there are three exits, east, west and the way back!"
The Lesser Death Room is east of the Death Room. "It is filled with spike traps!"
The Greater Death Room is west of the Death Room. "The Grim Reaper is standing before you!!!"
